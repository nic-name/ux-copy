# ux-copy
This document is an exploration in ux copy methods. The end result should be a portable JSON or XML file that a copywriter can update with correct copy without changing the code values in a project
The idea is code is protected and a copywriter has access only to a JSON or locale type file. The switch option shows how the developer can switch back to the original should anything go wrong. I used HTML and jquery to demonstrate this POC.
